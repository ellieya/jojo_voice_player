I want to have all the other pages LOAD, so that the user won't have overwhelming lag.


When HOME:
Navigation? Circle in the middle of the page.
Fixed navigation at the top of the page will disappear.

When going to OTHER, animation:
1) original size
2) slightly larger size
3) significant drop in size
4) small size
5) display: none
Make sure it is vertical-align:center;


When other:
Navigation? Placed ontop of the page; fixed
When going to home, animation:
1) fadeout


OTHER page format:
video playlist looping in the background
all videos will have a respective description.
Upon video load, 2 items will pop up on the left & right sides.
Left: Jump type
Right: Skater name
