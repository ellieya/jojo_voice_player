To-Do:

High priority:
-Video that covers the entire background, without causing a scroll (might be as simple as fixed position)
-Figure out all the jumps & write a small paragraph about them


-Figure out how to make height = 100% when position is relative



Low Priority:
-Prep the CSS animations
-Understand JS animations
-Figure out how to have other pages load. Obviously, we need AJAX, PHP, & a server to do this.
-Go in depth on the paragraphs
